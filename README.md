# DigiBank

An UPI like app for transferring Certificate

Certificate Bank is a **blockchain-based certificate storage and verification platform** that allows institutions to issue tamper-proof digital certificates, users to securely own and manage them, and verifiers to instantly validate authenticity — similar to how **UPI works for money, but for certificates**.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Educational and professional certificates today are:

- Easy to **forge or manipulate**
- Difficult to **verify instantly**
- Stored in **centralized systems** prone to loss or misuse
- Hard for individuals to **own and control**

There is no unified, secure, and globally verifiable system for digital certificates.

---

## 💡 Solution

**Certificate Bank** provides a **decentralized certificate ecosystem** where:

- Institutions issue verified certificates
- Certificates are stored securely using **IPFS**
- Proofs are recorded immutably on the **blockchain**
- Users fully own and control access to their certificates
- Verifiers can instantly validate authenticity without intermediaries
